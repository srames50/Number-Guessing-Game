# Number-Guessing-Game

This is a simple number guessing game written in Java. The computer generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess the number. The game provides feedback for each guess, telling the player whether their guess is too high or too low.

How to Play:

When the game starts, the computer will generate a random number between 1 and 100. The player must guess the number, and the computer will provide feedback for each guess.

To make a guess, enter a number between 1 and 100 when prompted. The computer will tell you whether your guess is too high or too low, and you can make another guess.

The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number. The game will then display the number of guesses it took to win the game.
